- What I want to achieve? I want to organize my music into playlists for:
  - XIX/XX music discovery,
  - commuting to work,
  - commuting home,
- album <- idea <- composer,
- maybe it is time to reintroduce the UDMS concept:
  - document (idea):
    - version:
        - incarnation:
            - location,
        - manifestation,
- fix project loading,
- web UI.
